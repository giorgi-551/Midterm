## 1. Challenges Faced and How I Resolved Them

During this exam, the main challenge was writing Java code since it is still new to me. I faced difficulties with understanding some Java constructs and how to implement them correctly. Additionally, using `.md` files for documentation was a bit of a challenge at first, but it wasnâ€™t too difficult to grasp. I resolved these issues by revisiting Java basics and practicing small code snippets. For `.md`, I referred to examples online and played around with the formatting to understand it better.

## 2. AI Tool Usefulness

AI was incredibly helpful throughout the process. It helped me quickly set up the initial structure of the code and provided suggestions to correct errors when I ran into issues. When I was unsure about how to implement a specific Java feature, AI provided useful explanations and code samples. It was especially useful when I encountered `.md` files for the first time. AI clarified how to structure the document and helped me understand the formatting. Despite this, I still had to review the generated code, make adjustments, and fine-tune it to ensure it met my requirements.

## 3. AI Limitations

While AI was an excellent tool for generating code and explanations, there were times when I had to manually go through the generated code to ensure everything worked correctly. Some suggestions needed modifications to better suit my specific needs. For example, AI would generate code with logic that wasn't entirely what I intended, so I had to rework it. Overall, AI was very helpful, but human intervention was still necessary to finalize the code.
